						<h1>About me</h1>
						<div class="aboutMeText">
							<p>
								Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Devon, a dedicated web developer with a
								passion for creating functional, user-friendly websites. My journey
								into the world of coding began on a smaller scale, but over time,
								I’ve honed my skills and continuously push myself to learn new
								technologies and techniques that elevate my work.
							</p>
							<p>
								Before diving into web development, I wore a few different hats. I
								started out as a carpenter, where I learned the value of precision
								and craftsmanship. After that, I spent some time as a truck driver,
								navigating long stretches of highway and gaining a strong sense of
								discipline and responsibility. These diverse experiences have shaped
								my approach to development, blending creativity, problem-solving,
								and a hands-on attitude.
							</p>
							<p>
								One thing that drives me is the constant pursuit of knowledge. I
								thrive on learning new things, whether it’s a new programming
								language, design principle, or an emerging trend in the tech world.
								This hunger for knowledge keeps me motivated and ensures that my
								work is always evolving.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, as a full-time developer, I’m focused on bringing my ideas to
								life through code. While I don’t have pets to distract me, my time
								is fully dedicated to perfecting my craft and staying up to date
								with the latest industry trends.
